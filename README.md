ü§ñ Use of AI Tools
Throughout the development of this project, I actively leveraged AI tools (specifically ChatGPT) to speed up learning and implementation, especially on the frontend side.

üîß Tools & How I Used Them
ChatGPT (GPT-4o):
Used as a coding assistant for real-time suggestions, error resolution, and learning new libraries. It acted like a pair programming partner during development.

‚ö° How AI Accelerated Development
Context API Over Redux Toolkit:
Previously, I was using Redux Toolkit, but with the help of AI, I learned and implemented React‚Äôs Context API architecture effectively. It helped me reduce boilerplate and simplify state management.

ShadCN UI + Tailwind CSS:
I was initially comfortable with Bootstrap and Tailwind. AI guided me step-by-step through learning and integrating ShadCN UI with Tailwind CSS, allowing me to build clean, modern, and consistent UI components much faster.

Project Structuring Tips:
AI helped me adopt better folder structures, separating concerns like index.tsx, type.ts, and context layers for scalability.

‚ùå Challenges & Resolutions
AI-Generated Code Bugs:
Sometimes the AI-generated code didn‚Äôt align perfectly with my setup (e.g., misnamed props or incorrect imports). I resolved these by deeply understanding the output, comparing it with official documentation, and debugging manually.

Generic Suggestions:
AI occasionally gave generic or outdated advice. I cross-checked solutions with the latest documentation or GitHub discussions to validate relevance.

‚úÖ My Approach to AI Suggestions
Validate first: I never blindly copy-pasted. I reviewed every suggestion and ensured it matched my use case and tech stack.

Test locally: All AI-generated code was tested thoroughly in the local environment before being committed.

Learn, not just use: I always asked why something works, not just how, so I could build my understanding while speeding up development.
